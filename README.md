Code for the ArduinoUNO which runs the Accessible Weighing Scale for Waggies by Maggie and Friends, created by University of Delaware Biomedical Engineering Junior Design Team 6, 2022.
Both files are meant to be used in the Arduino IDE
First use the "Calibration" File to calibrate your load cell (the basis for your weighing scale)
Next upload the "LoadCellWithTare" File to your Arduino, this file is responsible for the functionality of your scale
