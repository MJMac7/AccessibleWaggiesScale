# AccessibleWaggiesScale
Code for the ArduinoUNO which runs the Accessible Weighing Scale for Waggies by Maggie and Friends, created by University of Delaware Biomedical Engineering Junior Design Team 6, 2022.
Both files are meant to be used in the Arduino IDE
First use the "Calibration" File to calibrate your load cell (the basis for your weighing scale)
Next upload the "LoadCellWithTare" File to your Arduino, this file is responsible for the functionality of your scale

The Calibration code was originally provided by Arduino in the HX711 library, it is included here for convenience

The LoadCellWithTare code is adapted from a code on the open-source website Circuit Digest. The original code can be found at the following link:
